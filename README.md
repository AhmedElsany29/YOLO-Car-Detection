🚀 **YOLO-Based Car Detection**

***Object Detection Project using YOLO (You Only Look Once)***

I'm excited to share my latest project on **Car Detection using YOLO**, where I implemented real-time object detection techniques to identify and localize vehicles in images and videos. This project explores how deep learning and computer vision can be leveraged for autonomous driving and traffic surveillance applications.

🔍 **Project Overview:**

The objective of this project is to develop a **real-time car detection system** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. The model is trained to detect and classify cars in various environments and lighting conditions.

🛠 **Tools & Technologies:**

- **Python 🐍**
- **YOLOv8n**: Deep learning-based object detection model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and visualization.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch**: Backend frameworks for model training and inference.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing detection results.
- **Requests**: For fetching images and data from online sources.

🧠 **Modeling Approach:**

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
   - Used pre-labeled datasets for training and validation.
   - Applied image augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity.
   - Converted YOLO annotations from `[x_center, y_center, width, height]` to `[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]` for bounding box visualization.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Utilized **YOLOv5** pre-trained weights for transfer learning.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
   
3. **Evaluation & Optimization:**
   - Used **mAP (Mean Average Precision)** and **IoU (Intersection over Union)** to assess model accuracy.
   - Adjusted confidence thresholds to minimize false detections.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Developed a **real-time detection pipeline** for live camera feeds.
   - Integrated the model into a **Flask API** for easy accessibility.
   - Added support for **video processing** and frame-by-frame object detection.

🔧 **Model Performance:**

- Achieved **high detection accuracy** on test images and videos.
- Optimized inference speed for real-time applications.
- Successfully detected multiple car instances in various lighting and weather conditions.
- Improved object tracking by assigning unique colors to detected classes.
